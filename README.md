# Basic Weather App
A very basic weather app written in GoLang. 
<br>
It uses HTTP calls to an API (owned by OpenWeatherMap), which fetches real-time info about the weather in the City you've specified.
<br>
Generally, you should be careful of info sent over the HTTP method - as it's incredibly unsecured - but this scenario is more or less ok, as there's no Personal/Confidential info being sent!

## having trouble running the app?:
remember to initialize and compile the go package by running commands like your "go mod init", etc.
<br>
You can see the [official "go" method's documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go) for more, or simply google the commands to run!
